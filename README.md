# Almost Pinterest

Hello, and welcome to my app, Almost-Pinterest. It is a simplified version of the popular website Pinterest, a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home, and style inspiration. When a user discovers Pins they love, they can save them to boards to keep their ideas organized and easy to find. This simplified version includes a way for users to create boards and can pin URLs to the boards.

#### User Stories
* As a user, when I am logged in and the page loads, I should see all the boards that belong to me.
* As a user, when I click on one of my boards, I should see a single board view that shows all pins for that board.
* As a user, when I am on the single board view, there should be some way to go back to all my boards.

## Functionality Includes: 

### Part 1: ERDs and Authentication
* Create an ERD for pinterest (do this in studygroup)
* Clone this repo
* Create a setup branch
* Do all the stuff needed when setting up the project. Reference the webpack instructions if needed. These include making the updates to the `.env` file
* Create a new firebase project, database, and enable google authentication, etc.
* Create an authentication branch and add a navbar with logout button, and place the google login button somewhere for you to test
* We just want you to get your auth setup by yourself.**
* When your user is **logged out** they should see the navbar with only a brand.  And an h1 on the page that says PINTEREST (make a `home` component for this)
* When your user is logged in they should see a navbar with a brand and a logout button and an H1 on the page that says Boards (make a `boards` component for this)

### Part 2: READ

* Create some json data
* Import that data into firebase
### Part 3: DELETE
